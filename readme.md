# Objectives
Spigot, which implements on BukkitAPI, is one of the most popular server API for Minecraft. 
However, I admit that the Spigot itself are not contains many utilities API for developers to construct their plugins. 
This library provides a tons of functionality to resolve developers general issues in real-life code in order to reduce 
plugin building phase-times.

# Modules
- `pn-core`: main project
  - `pncore-mysql`: JDBC MySQL driver implement on Connector/J
  - `pncore-utils`: includes many utilities for most missing functionality of Spigot.
